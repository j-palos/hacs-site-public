# Pre-Setup Setup
You will need:  
- node.js
- npm
- git
- a text editor of your choice or IDE. Brackets, VSCode, and Webstorm are all great.

You can get node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/. MacOS can also get it using `homebrew`. 
That should also have installed `npm` for you.
You can find `git` if you don't have it already at https://git-scm.com/downloads .
We will post a tutorial on git shortly, but you can also check [this one here](http://noodle.med.yale.edu/hdtag/notes/git_tut.pdf).

# Quick Start
Clone the repo. Put it somewhere more permanent than the Downloads folder. Navigate in terminal/powershell to the project and use 
>npm install

This installs all packages/libraries you currently needed for this project locally. You can start the development server with
> npm start

This is a script in the package.json file. It's function is to start up webpack and a developer server where your changes will be watched and automatically recompiled so you can see them live. If a tab isn't opened automatically, you can go to 
`http://localhost:8080/`
Feel free to mess around with the code and see what happens.
